# Mastering CSS Grid

Welcome to Abhaya's Blog where you get access to all the latest tech Abhaya is learning and sharing. This is the starter course for people learning and starting out to CSS

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows developers to create complex and flexible grid-based layouts with ease. With Grid, you can define rows and columns, and place elements in specific grid areas. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of CSS Grid and show you how to create grid-based layouts.

## üñäÔ∏èGetting Started with CSS Grid

To create a grid layout, you first need to define a grid container. This is done by applying the `display: grid` property to an element. Once an element is a grid container, you can define rows and columns using the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties, respectively.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a grid container with two rows and two columns. The first row has a height of 100 pixels, the second row has a height of 200 pixels, the first column has a width of one fraction, and the second column has a width of two fractions.

Once you've defined your grid container and your rows and columns, you can start placing elements in specific grid areas. This is done using the `grid-row` and `grid-column` properties.

```css
.item {
  grid-row: 1 / 2;
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}
```
In the above example, we've defined an element with the class item and placed it in the second column of the first row.

## Creating Grid Gaps

To create gaps between grid rows and columns, you can use the `grid-row-gap` and `grid-column-gap` properties, respectively.

```css 
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  grid-row-gap: 10px;
  grid-column-gap: 20px;
}
```

In the above example, we've added gaps of 10 pixels between rows and gaps of 20 pixels between columns.

## Using Grid Areas

Grid areas allow you to name specific areas of your grid and place elements in those areas using the `grid-area` property.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "nav main"
    "footer footer";
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}

.nav {
  grid-area: nav;
}

.main {
  grid-area: main;
}

.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
```
In the above example, we've defined a grid container with three rows and two columns, and we've named specific areas using the `grid-template-areas` property. We've then placed elements in those areas using the `grid-area` property.

## Conclusion

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows developers to create complex and flexible grid-based layouts with ease. In this tutorial, we've explored the basics of CSS Grid and shown you how to create grid-based layouts. With its powerful features and flexible syntax, CSS Grid is a valuable tool for creating modern and responsive web layouts.
