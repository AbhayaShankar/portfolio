# The Future of Web Development: Web Assembly

Welcome to Abhaya's Blog where you get access to all the latest tech Abhaya is learning and sharing. This is the starter course for people learning and starting out to Web Assembly.

## ❓What is Web Assembly?

WebAssembly is a powerful technology that enables developers to run high-performance code in the browser at near-native speed. By serving as a low-level virtual machine that can execute code written in multiple high-level programming languages, WebAssembly provides a versatile compilation target for web developers.

One of the most exciting new technologies on the horizon is Web Assembly. Web Assembly, or wasm for short, is a low-level virtual machine that allows developers to run code at near-native speed in the browser. It's designed as a compilation target for multiple high-level programming languages, which means that developers can write code in languages they're already familiar with, such as C++, Rust, or Go, and have that code run in the browser alongside JavaScript.

## 🚀The Benefits of Web Assembly

There are several benefits to using Web Assembly in web development such as:

1. Web Assembly provides a way to run performance-intensive code in the browser at near-native speed. This opens up new possibilities for web developers, enabling them to create more complex and powerful applications than ever before.

2. Web Assembly is designed to work alongside JavaScript, not replace it. This means that developers can continue to use JavaScript for tasks such as DOM manipulation and user interface interactions, while using Web Assembly for performance-intensive tasks such as game engines, scientific simulations, or media codecs.

3.  Web Assembly is a portable technology, meaning that developers can write code once and run it on multiple platforms without the need for recompilation. This makes it a versatile tool for creating cross-platform applications that run seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## 🔥Getting Started with Web Assembly

If you're interested in exploring Web Assembly in your own web development projects, there are several resources available to help you get started. The [Official Web Assembly Website](https://abhayablog.vercel.app/) provides comprehensive documentation and tutorials on how to use Web Assembly in your code.

Additionally, there are several open-source projects and libraries available that make it easy to integrate Web Assembly into your web development workflow. WASM-bindgen is a Rust library that makes it easy to call JavaScript functions from Web Assembly, and vice versa. AssemblyScript is a TypeScript-like language that compiles to Web Assembly, providing a familiar syntax for developers who are already familiar with JavaScript.

## 🏃Loading and Running Web Assembly Modules

To load and run a Web Assembly module in JavaScript, you can use the `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` method. This method loads the Web Assembly module from a URL and returns a promise that resolves to a Web Assembly instance.

```js
const url = 'example.wasm';
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then(buffer => WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer))
  .then(module => {
    // Use the Web Assembly module here
  });
```

## Passing Data Between JavaScript and Web Assembly

To pass data between JavaScript and Web Assembly, you can use the `WebAssembly.Memory` object to allocate and read/write memory in the Web Assembly module.

``` js 
// Allocate memory in the Web Assembly module
const memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 1 });
const wasmModule = new WebAssembly.Module(wasmCode);
const wasmInstance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasmModule, {
  env: {
    memory
  }
});

// Write data to the allocated memory in the Web Assembly module
const data = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, 0, 4);
data.set([0, 1, 2, 3]);

// Read data from the allocated memory in the Web Assembly module
const result = wasmInstance.exports.add(2, 3);
console.log(result);    
```

## Calling JavaScript Functions from Web Assembly

To call JavaScript functions from Web Assembly, you can use the `WebAssembly.Module` and `WebAssembly.Instance` constructors to create an interface that exports JavaScript functions to the Web Assembly module.

```js 
// Define a JavaScript function to be exported to the Web Assembly module
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Create an interface that exports the JavaScript function to the Web Assembly module
const imports = {
  env: {
    add
  }
};
const wasmModule = new WebAssembly.Module(wasmCode);
const wasmInstance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasmModule, imports);

// Call the exported JavaScript function from the Web Assembly module
const result = wasmInstance.exports.call_add(2, 3);
console.log(result);
```

## 🎉Conclusion

Web Assembly is a powerful new technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and interact with web applications. By enabling developers to write high-performance code in languages they're already familiar with, Web Assembly opens up new possibilities for creating complex and powerful applications that run seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

If you're a web developer looking to explore the cutting-edge of web development, Web Assembly is definitely a technology worth investigating. With comprehensive documentation, open-source libraries, and a vibrant community of developers, the future of web development is looking bright indeed!
