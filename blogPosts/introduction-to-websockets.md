## üëã Welcome to Introduction to Web Sockets

> _Once upon a time when internet was at it's development phase, there lived a man named Abhaya who had a girlfriend ( imaginary ofcourse ü•≤), he wanted to talk to his girlfriend. Being a developer, Abhaya created an app using http method. He created a database where he would store all the chats and he would then fetch all the data and then render on a screen. Such was his invention, which in future came to be known as chatting App._
>
> _But as always, his girlfriend shouted at him : "What Rubbish website have you built! I have to Refresh the website everytime to check if you have sent any new message to me or not..." These words made Abhaya question himself "Is this method correct ?"_
>
> _This lead Abhaya to go back to the fundamentals of the Request and Response and the channel by which this communication is made. He then decided to make a new type of connection which will ensure the connection to be open till he and his girlfriend chat and not to close this till they had shared all their stories. This type of connection later came to be known as **Web Socket Connections**._

Hello Everyone, hope you liked the story üòÇ
My name is Abhaya Shankar and I will be your instructor for this short crash course where I will teach you all you need to know before you start working with websockets.

## Chapters we will be covering in this blog

1. What are widely used network protocols and how do they work ?
2. Which protocol do websockets use and why is it important ?
3. What is the difference between HTTP Polling, HTTP Streaming, SSE, and Web Sockets ?
4. Why should we use websockets in the first place...
5. How exactly do websockets work?
6. How to create websockets.
7. Real-time Examples where Web sockets are used.
8. Scenarios where you should be using websockets and where not to.

Before we start our topic on websockets, it's essential to know about the different protocols and why the need for web sockets came in the first place.

There are fair share of protocols used on day-to-day basis but we remain to seem unfamiliarised with them. Let's quickly talk about them and we will then jump back to our discussion here. We are going to talk about all the protocols but our discussion will be limited to the protocols which concerns to this topic. To name a few they are **HTTP/HTTPS**, **TCP**, **IP** and **UDP**.

1. **HTTP/HTTPS** : Which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) is an Application layer protocol used for transmitting hypertexts docs such as HTML. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and is essential for web development. Both HTTP and HTTPS are used for transferring data over the web.

The key difference between _HTTP_ and _HTTPS_ is **Security**. HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It uses a secure, encrypted connection, typically using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted, providing confidentiality and integrity.

2. **TCP/IP** : Which stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol specifies how devices exchange data over the internet. They are the fundamental suite of protocols for communication on the internet. TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.

The _TCP_ defines how application create communication channels and also manages how the data can be broken down into different packets/packages to be then transmitted over the internet and then re-assemble at the destination.

_IP_ defines how to address and route each packet/packages to ensures they are received at the destination.

They are designed for network reliability and auto recovery from failures. If suppose a packet which has to be received at the destination, for some reason didn't arrive at the destination, then the TCP/IP will ensure to look for the lost packet and recover it over the internet.

> In Short **TCP** is designed to ensure reliable and ordered delivery of data. If a packet is lost in transit, TCP employs retransmission mechanisms, flow control, and congestion control to recover the lost data. These mechanisms contribute to the robustness and reliability of **TCP/IP-based** communication over networks, making it suitable for applications that require accurate and complete data delivery.

3. **UDP** : Stands for User Datagram Protocol. Its working is quite similar to TCP/IP. Here also the data is broken down into packets ( referred to as **datagrams** ) in the case of UDP protocols but UDP is connectionless, meaning it does not establish a connection before sending data. Each datagram is independent of others, making it faster but less reliable than connection-oriented protocols like TCP. It doesn't have much error checking as compared to TCP. Moreover, in transit, if a datagram is lost, it is not traceable, meaning it cannot be recovered.

> In short, **UDP** is preferred for scenarios where speed and low latency are more critical than ensuring every piece of data is delivered. Its simplicity and reduced overhead make it suitable for real-time applications and situations where occasional packet loss can be tolerated.

Hope, all that made sense to you. Now once we are familiar with these terms. Let's move back to our discussion about web sockets.

> In the modern era where internet is used more extensively than anything else, you might have used **Whatsapp**, **Facebook** and **Instagram**. Real-time messaging is one of the key features which was why there messaging social platforms are widely used.

I believe now you know about or atleast heard of HTTP/HTTPS protocol. The working of which is simple where a client sends a request to the server and the request is then processed and if everything is good, server will then send the 200 OK response. If any error or issue with the request, it will send back a 403/404/500 response error depending upon the type of error.

If all these seems gibberish to you, make sure you atleast have a basic knowledge of this. You can refer this [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview).

Let's now understand how this would actually work like with a real-scenario based example. Let's say I went to a restaurant to eat ramen üçú.
I would then ask the waiter for a menu to check which ramen they sell and upon then order.

1. I ( client ) will then order the desired ramen and then the waiter ( connection ) will take up that order to the kitchen ( server ).

2. The chef in the kitchen will then check if they know how to prepare the order ( processing the request ) and then prepare my ramen ( response ).

3. The waiter ( connection ) will then come back to me ( client ) with the finished Ramen ( Response ).

4. If the chefs in the Kitchen don't know how to prepare the ramen then the waiter will come back with apologies ( Error 500 or 404 ) that they couldn't process the order.

Such is the working of the HTTP connections. Now if I wanted to add eggs to the ramen, I would have to call the waiter and let him pass on the message to the chef, and for every request, I would have to call the waiter again and again.

Such was the issue which Abhaya from the story was facing while he was chatting with his girlfriend.

What if I could have a way to communicate with the chef in the kitchen directly ? Interesting right then no need of contacting the waiter again and again yeah ?

Let's take a food truck instead of a restaurant then what would happen. I would directly talk to the chef of the food truck and would tell the chef that I want to eat ramen, if he knows he would directly tell me if he knows or not. I wouldn't wait for the response to come back and if yes, he knows how to prepare later if I want to add eggs I would directly tell him that I want eggs, please add them too. This type of conversation is more profound and better. Don't you think so ?

Hope you get the point. Web Sockets are such connections where the client directly communicates with the server. If the server would want to transmit/send any data to the client it would do so directly.

Now if the client or server anyone closes the channel, the connection is closed.
Ex. If you have had your fair share of food and you would want to go now. You ( client ) will close this channel and the connection will be closed If the Shop owner wants to close the shop, then he will terminate the channel and the connection will be closed.
