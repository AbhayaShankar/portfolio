## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Introduction to Web Sockets

> _Once upon a time when internet was at it's development phase, there lived a man named Abhaya who had a girlfriend ( imaginary ofcourse ðŸ¥²), he wanted to talk to his girlfriend. Being a developer, Abhaya created an app using http method. He created a database where he would store all the chats and he would then fetch all the data and then render on a screen. Such was his invention, which in future came to be known as chatting App._
>
> _But as always, his girlfriend shouted at him : "What Rubbish website have you built! I have to Refresh the website everytime to check if you have sent any new message to me or not..." These words made Abhaya question himself "Is this method correct ?"_
