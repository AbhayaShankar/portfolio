## 👋 Welcome to Working with webRTCs 🌐

> _Suppose you are playing a multiplayer online game 🎮 and for some reason, you lose your network, and your game lags and after 10-12s it comes back online. Now during these 10-12s, you would have lost many data but do you want to start the game as if you pressed "𝐏𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 and 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲" or do you want it to be "𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞" to get back to the fight._
>
> Which among the two would you prefer ? And I am pretty damn sure we all will be choosing "**Live**" one. Such is the use case of webRTC which stands for Real time communication for the web.

## 📖 What You will be learning ?

1. What are webRTC features?
2. What protocols it uses and why can't we use web sockets?
3. Working of WebRTC.
4. Real-time Examples where web sockets are used.

## 🤏 Prerequisites

- If you have worked with javascript and React, then you will be good to go.
- Basic knowledge of Nodejs, Express and web sockets. (If you don't have prior knowledge of web sockets you can refer to this **[LINK](introduction-to-websockets)**)
- You need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
- Interest to learn something new 💡.
- And a cup of coffee. ☕

## 🤩 Congratulations! You did it 🔥🔥

Great! You have successfully completed this comprehensive blog on webRTC.
You deserve a toast 🥂. Now you can proceed with some new ideas to create a video calling app using webRTC. If you have been following up and have created something, make sure to showcase your project connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhayashankar/).
