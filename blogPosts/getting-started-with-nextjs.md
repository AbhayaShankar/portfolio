# My Blog for Next.js

Welcome to Abhaya's Blog where you get access to all the latest tech Abhaya is learning and sharing. This is the starter course for people learning and starting out to Next.js

Next.js is a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications. With Next.js, you can build high-performance, SEO-friendly web applications with ease. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating a blog using Next.js.

## üñäÔ∏èGetting Started with Next.js

To get started with Next.js, you first need to create a new Next.js project. You can do this using the `create-next-app` command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog
```

Once you've created your Next.js project, you can start building your blog.

## ‚ûïCreating Pages in Next.js

In Next.js, you can create pages using the `pages` directory. Each file in the `pages` directory represents a page in your application. For example, you can create a `pages/index.js` file to represent the home page of your blog.

```js
function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>;
}

export default HomePage;
```

In the above example, we've created a simple home page component that displays a welcome message.

## Using Dynamic Routing in Next.js

Next.js allows you to use dynamic routing to create dynamic pages in your application. You can do this by creating a file with square brackets in the `pages` directory. For example, you can create a `pages/posts/[slug].js` file to represent a dynamic post page.

```js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

function PostPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return <h1>Post: {slug}</h1>;
}

export default PostPage;
```

In the above example, we've created a dynamic post page component that uses the `useRouter` hook to get the current post slug from the router query.

## Fetching Data in Next.js

Next.js allows you to fetch data for your pages using the `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` functions. `getStaticProps` is used to fetch data at build time, while `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch data at runtime.

```jsx
function HomePage({ posts }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  };
}
```

In the above example, we've used `getStaticProps` to fetch a list of posts from a JSON API and pass them as a prop to the home page component.

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework for building server-side rendered React applications. In this tutorial, we've walked you through the process of creating a blog using Next.js. With its powerful features and flexible API, Next.js is a valuable tool for building modern and performant web applications.
